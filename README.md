üéØ Comprehensive Ethical Hacking Reconnaissance Toolkit v2.0.0
‚ö° Multi-threaded vulnerability scanning with PoC verification
üîç Subdomain enumeration ‚Üí httpx ‚Üí deep vulnerability analysis workflow
üõ°Ô∏è For authorized security testing and bug bounty research only
Overview

EthicalRecon is a professional-grade vulnerability scanner designed specifically for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and bug bounty researchers. Built to integrate seamlessly with the popular subdomain enumeration ‚Üí httpx ‚Üí vulnerability scanning workflow, it provides comprehensive security testing with advanced PoC verification to eliminate false positives.
Key Features
üöÄ Advanced Vulnerability Detection

    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Context-aware detection with JavaScript execution verification
    SQL Injection - Time-based, error-based, and union-based detection with database fingerprinting
    Local File Inclusion (LFI) - File signature verification and wrapper exploitation
    Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Command execution verification with unique markers
    Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Cloud metadata and internal service testing
    Open Redirects - External domain redirection verification

üéØ Proof-of-Concept Verification

    Real-time PoC generation for each vulnerability found
    False positive reduction through advanced verification techniques
    Execution proof displayed in terminal for immediate validation
    Ready-to-use exploit commands for security reporting

‚ö° Performance & Integration

    Multi-threaded scanning with configurable thread pools
    httpx output compatibility - Direct integration with subdomain enumeration workflows
    URL parameter handling - Robust parsing of complex URLs with multiple parameters
    Rate limiting and respectful scanning practices

üìä Comprehensive Reporting

    Multiple output formats: JSON, HTML, and text reports
    Executive summaries with vulnerability statistics
    Technical details with CVSS scoring and OWASP mapping
    Curl commands and remediation advice included

Installation
Quick Install (Recommended)

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethicalrecon.git
cd ethicalrecon

# Run the automated installer
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

Manual Installation

# Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
python3 --version

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Make script executable
chmod +x ethicalrecon.py

Usage
Basic Examples
Scan URLs from httpx output file

python3 ethicalrecon.py -f live_hosts.txt -o results

Scan a single URL

python3 ethicalrecon.py -u "http://example.com/search?q=test" -o single_scan

Advanced scanning with custom settings

python3 ethicalrecon.py -f httpx_output.txt -t 20 --format html,json --timeout 15

Workflow Integration

EthicalRecon is designed to integrate perfectly with your existing reconnaissance workflow:

# 1. Subdomain enumeration
subfinder -d target.com -silent | httpx -silent > live_hosts.txt

# 2. Vulnerability scanning with EthicalRecon
python3 ethicalrecon.py -f live_hosts.txt -o vulnerability_scan

# 3. Review results
ls vulnerability_scan/

Command Line Options

Input Options:
  -f, --file        File containing URLs to scan (one per line)
